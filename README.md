libsoundio .NET and Mono Binding (http://libsound.io)

The goal of this binding is to support all platforms that libsoundio supports. Currently tested against both Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) and Windows 10.

This binding is a full abstraction wrapper around libsoundio, meaning that the use of the library and the way the API is presented looks like a typical .NET library. All native platform invokes and marshaling should be encapsulated by the library.

This binding is currently a work in-progress.
